<h1> NYC Taxi Predictions </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was my entry for the Taxi Trip Fare Prediction Challenge hosted by Gaurav Dutta on Kaggle: "This hackathon provides a historical dataset to participants that includes records of taxi trip details and fares of those trips. Using this dataset, the participants need to build machine learning models for predicting the trip fare based on the given other useful features of the trip." (Dutta, 2022).
