<h1> NYC Taxi Predictions </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This was my entry for the Taxi Trip Fare Prediction Challenge hosted by Gaurav Dutta on Kaggle: "This hackathon provides a historical dataset to participants that includes records of taxi trip details and fares of those trips. Using this dataset, the participants need to build machine learning models for predicting the trip fare based on the given other useful features of the trip." (Dutta, 2022).

<h3>Cleaning The Dataset</h3>
 <b>With nearly 55 million data points, we needed to ensure all outliers, missing values, and obvious mistakes were removed from the set.</b>

<h3>Catagoizing The Dataset</h3>

<b>I categorized the distances in 4 range categories using the graph below:</b>
<b>“0km-5km”</br>
<b>“5km-10km”</br>
<b>“10km-15km”</br>
<b>“15km-20km”</br>

<b>I then categorized the fare ranges into 4 different categories</b>
<b>“$2.5-$23.0” for distance between 0km-5km</br>
<b>“6.0-$37.87” for distance between 5km-10km</br>
<b>“17.7-$45.0” for distance between 10km-15km</br>
<b>“$26.5-$57.54” for distance between 15km-20km</br>
